UniCompanion : Multilingual Chat Application. 
## About :: 
### UniCompanion is a Social Media App that makes talking in different languages easy. People pick their language for chatting, so there are no language problems. When someone sends a message, UniCompanion's clever system jumps in. If the other person speaks a different language, it quickly changes the message, making sure it makes sense. This helps everyone chat in their own language without any trouble.

### This app uses the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) to make sure it works well and looks good. Plus, it has a smart language translation feature using a special ML model. This way, people from different languages can chat clearly and understand each other better.

### Note :: Currently it supports only English to Hindi and vice versa.
